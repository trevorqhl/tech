# About SSH Keys
SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a server with SSH than using a password. SSH keys are nearly impossible to decipher by brute force.

Generating a key pair provides you with two long string of characters: a public and a private key. You can place the public key on any server, and then unlock it by connecting to it with a client that already has the private key. When the two match up, the system unlocks without the need for a password.

Create the RSA Key Pair
```
# Login as yourself
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

# Store the Keys and Passphrase (more secure but optionally)

Once you have entered keygen command, you will get a few more questions:
```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/trevorl/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can press enter here
```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

It’s up to you whether you want to use a passphrase. Entering a passphrase will secure the private key even you should only keep it to yourself

# Copy the Public Key
Once the key pair is generated, it’s time to place the public key on the server that we want to use.

You can copy the public key into the new machine’s authorized_keys file with the ssh-copy-id command. Make sure to replace the example username and IP address below.
```
ssh-copy-id demo@192.168.100.2
```
# Install the Public Key to Github
You can also install the Public key to Github so that you do not need to enter theh password everytime you sync with Github
{% highlight ruby %}
# List your Public Key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
# Login to Github.com and navigate to 
#-> Edit Profile
#->-> SSH and GPG Keys
#->->-> New SSH key
#->->->-> Make a name and paste the key here
#->->->->-> Enter your github password to confirm

# Go back to your local repo, and list you remote URL
git remote -v

# Update remote URL to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:trevorqhl/trevorqhl.github.io.git

# Verify remote URL
git remote -v

{% endhighlight %}
